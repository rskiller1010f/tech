                <p>Transparency about how we earn revenue</p>

        <!-- Affiliate Disclosure Content -->
        <section class="section">
            <div class="content-page">
                <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2024</p>

                <div class="notice-box" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> TechLearnHub is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.in.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>What This Means</h2>
                <p>As an Amazon Associate, TechLearnHub earns from qualifying purchases. This means that when you click on product links on our website and make a purchase on Amazon, we may receive a small commission at no additional cost to you.</p>

                <h2>How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
                <p>When you click on a product link on TechLearnHub:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You are redirected to Amazon.in (or the relevant Amazon marketplace)</li>
                    <li>Amazon tracks that you came from our website using a special affiliate link</li>
                    <li>If you make a purchase within a certain time period (typically 24 hours), we earn a small percentage of the sale</li>
                    <li>The price you pay remains exactly the same - there is no extra charge to you</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Our Commitment to Honesty</h2>
                <p>We want to be completely transparent about our affiliate relationships:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Extra Cost:</strong> You never pay more for products purchased through our links. The commission comes from Amazon, not from your pocket.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unbiased Recommendations:</strong> Our product recommendations are based on research, reviews, and value assessment - not on commission rates. We recommend products we genuinely believe offer good value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Editorial Independence:</strong> Our affiliate relationship with Amazon does not influence our content or the products we choose to feature. We maintain complete editorial independence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Honest Reviews:</strong> We strive to provide honest, balanced information about products, including any potential drawbacks or limitations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
                <p>Running a website requires time, effort, and resources. The affiliate commissions we earn help us:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep the website running and maintained</li>
                    <li>Continue researching and recommending new products</li>
                    <li>Provide free content and recommendations to our readers</li>
                    <li>Invest in improving the user experience</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your support through these affiliate links enables us to continue helping Indian consumers find great budget tech products.</p>

                <h2>Amazon Associates Program</h2>
                <p>The Amazon Associates Program is one of the largest and most trusted affiliate programs in the world. As a participant:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We are required to disclose our affiliate relationship (which this page fulfills)</li>
                    <li>We must comply with Amazon's Operating Agreement and policies</li>
                    <li>We cannot make false claims about products or prices</li>
                    <li>We must clearly identify ourselves as an Amazon Associate</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Product Prices</h2>
                <p>Please note that prices and availability of products on Amazon change frequently. While we try to keep our content updated, the prices shown in our articles or recommendations may not reflect the current price on Amazon. Always check the actual price on Amazon before making a purchase decision.</p>

                <h2>Not Affiliated with Amazon Directly</h2>
                <p>TechLearnHub is an independent website and is not owned, operated, or endorsed by Amazon. We are simply participants in their affiliate program. Any issues with products, orders, shipping, or returns should be directed to Amazon's customer service.</p>

                <h2>Other Affiliate Relationships</h2>
                <p>Currently, our primary affiliate relationship is with Amazon India. If we establish relationships with other affiliate programs in the future, we will update this disclosure accordingly.</p>

                <h2>Questions?</h2>
                <p>If you have any questions about our affiliate relationships or this disclosure, please feel free to <a href="contact.html" style="color: var(--primary-blue);">contact us</a>. We're happy to provide more information about how we operate.</p>
